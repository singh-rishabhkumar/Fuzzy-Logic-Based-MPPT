# Fuzzy-Logic-Based-MPPT

In this study, simulation and hardware implementation of Fuzzy Logic (FL) 
Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) used in photovoltaic system with a direct 
control method are presented. 
In this control system, no proportional or integral 
control loop exists and an adaptive FL controller generates the control signals. The 
designed and integrated system is a contribution of different aspects which 
includes simulation, design and programming and experimental setup.
